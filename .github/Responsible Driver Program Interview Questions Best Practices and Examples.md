If you have been prohibited from driving due to alcohol or drug-related offences, you may be required to complete the Responsible Driver Program (RDP) before you can get your licence back. The RDP is a remedial program that aims to reduce the risk of repeat offences and improve road safety. The RDP is run by Stroh Health Care for RoadSafetyBC.
  
One of the first steps of the RDP is a phone interview with a Stroh counsellor. The interview will help determine whether you need to take an 8-hour or a 16-hour education program. The interview will also assess your readiness to change your behaviour and your motivation to complete the program.

The interview questions may vary depending on your individual situation, but here are some common topics that you may encounter:
  
- Your driving history and the circumstances of your prohibition
- Your alcohol or drug use patterns and how they affect your driving
- Your awareness of the consequences of impaired driving
- Your coping skills and strategies to avoid impaired driving in the future
- Your goals and expectations for the RDP

To prepare for the interview, you should:

- Review your referral letter from RoadSafetyBC and visit Stroh Health Care's website for more information on the RDP
- Be honest and cooperative with the counsellor and answer the questions as best as you can
- Reflect on your reasons for wanting to complete the RDP and get your licence back
- Think of examples of how you have changed or plan to change your behaviour to prevent impaired driving
- Have a pen and paper ready to take notes and write down any questions you may have for the counsellor

The RDP interview is an opportunity for you to show that you are committed to becoming a responsible driver. By preparing well, you can increase your chances of being assigned to the appropriate program and completing it successfully.

## How much does the Responsible Driver Program cost?
  
The Responsible Driver Program is not free. You have to pay a program fee of \*\*$930\*\* plus tax to enrol in the program[^1^] [^4^]. This fee covers the cost of the phone interview, the education sessions, and the materials. You have to pay the fee regardless of whether you are assigned to the 8-hour or the 16-hour program.
  
If you cannot afford to pay the fee, you may be eligible for a payment plan or a fee reduction. You have to contact Stroh Health Care and provide proof of your income and expenses to apply for financial assistance. You may also be able to claim the fee as a medical expense on your income tax return.
  
If you fail to pay the fee or complete the program, you may face further consequences. RoadSafetyBC may extend your driving prohibition or require you to install an ignition interlock device on your vehicle. The ignition interlock device is another costly remedial program that requires you to provide a breath sample before starting your vehicle.
  
## What are the benefits of completing the Responsible Driver Program?
  
The Responsible Driver Program is not only a requirement for getting your licence back, but also a valuable opportunity for learning and personal growth. The program can help you:

- Understand the effects of alcohol and drugs on your driving ability and judgement
- Recognize the signs and symptoms of substance use problems
- Develop skills and strategies to cope with stress, emotions, and peer pressure
- Make informed and responsible decisions about your driving behaviour
- Reduce the risk of future impaired driving incidents and penalties

The Responsible Driver Program is based on evidence-based practices and delivered by qualified counsellors. The program uses interactive activities, group discussions, videos, and worksheets to engage participants and enhance their learning experience. The program also provides referrals and resources for participants who need further support or treatment.
  
By completing the Responsible Driver Program, you can demonstrate that you are committed to becoming a safer and more responsible driver. You can also regain your driving privileges and avoid further sanctions from RoadSafetyBC.
